    "Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that allows computers to learn from data and improve automatically without being explicitly programmed for every task.Instead of giving the computer fixed rules for every situation, we give it a lot of data and examples, and it finds patterns on its own. For example, if we show a computer many emails labeled as spam or not spam it learns the difference and can identify new spam emails by itself.Machine Learning allows computers to improve and make better decisions automatically by learning from data."
